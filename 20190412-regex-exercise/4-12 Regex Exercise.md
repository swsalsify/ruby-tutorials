The exercise we'll be looking at is: https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/ruby-regular-expressions/blob/master/exercises.md

Please create a regular expression that follows all the guidelines laid out in that exercise. If you'd like to make the exercise a little more challenging for yourself, here are some suggestions to spice it up:

* Create a program that gets some input from the user and prints out a response to the terminal. It should respond "Oh yeah, we're definitely talking about regular expressions" if the text matches the regex you created for the exercise, and "I don't think we're talking about regular expressions" if it does not match.
 * To get some input from the User, you can use the "gets" function. EX(getting text input and printing it to the terminal, try it out in pry):

string = gets.chomp
puts string

* After completing the above, turn your program into a loop that continually asks the user for input until a user inputs something that does not match the regex.
